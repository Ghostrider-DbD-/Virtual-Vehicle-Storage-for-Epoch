Thats it !

Added one setting:
  preciseSpawnLocation = 0/1;  // Set to 0 to have the vehicle spawned at the spot it was stored from; set this to 1 to have the vehicle spawned in a safe spot within 20 meters.

Fixed one exploit:
  Players can no longer store temporary vehicles 

Fixed one small error:
   Lock ownership was improerly set when the player was part of a group.
